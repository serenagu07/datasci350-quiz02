title: "Life Expectancy and Population"
---

This page analyses the relationship between life expectancy and population using the Gapminder dataset.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("gapminder.csv")

plt.figure()
plt.scatter(df["population_millions"], df["life_expectancy"])
plt.xlabel("Population (millions)")
plt.ylabel("Life Expectancy")
plt.title("Life Expectancy vs Population")

plt.show()
```

**Analysis:** There is no simple linear relationship between population size and life expectancy. Many small and large countries can have both low and high life expectancy.
